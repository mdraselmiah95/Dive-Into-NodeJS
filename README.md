## NodeJS Express MongoDB MasterðŸ”¥

### [[Chapter Notes]]

- **Node JS** installation from official site nodejs.org - use only LTS versions
- Use **terminal / command prompt** to check installation :
  `node -v`
  `npm -v `
- **VS Code** installation directly from code.visualstudio.com site
- Use VS code terminal to run **commands**
- **Node REPL** interface can be used directly by typing `node` in **terminal / command prompt** . Use **Ctrl+D** to exit interface. Use **CTRL+C** to exit terminal
- Running any JavaScript file from node using `node filename.js`
- **Modules** are basic containers in Node/JavaScript system. 1 file can be one module in Javascript.
- Two type of Module Systems in node JS are - **CommonJS** module and **ES** Modules.

- FileSystem Module(fs) is one of core modules of Node JS. **fs** can be used to read/write any file. There are many more core modules in NodeJS which you can check in NodeJS API docs.
- Reading files can be **Synchronous** or **Asynchronous**. **Async** is most preferred method in NodeJS. As there is **NO blocking of I/O in NodeJS**

- Node project can be initialized with `npm init` command which also creates `package.json` file
- **package.json** is a configuration file for node projects which has **scripts**, **dependencies**, **devDependencies** etc
- `npm install <package-name>` is used to install any online modules available for node on NPM repository online.
- `nodemon` is a package for running node server and track live changes to re-start again.
- `scripts` inside **package.json** can be used like `npm run <script-name>` e.g `npm run dev`. Only for `npm start` you can avoid `run`.
- use `npm install -g <package.json>` to install packages globally on your system. Not just in the project but useful all over your system.
- Node versions are formatted like **4.1.9** where these are `major.minor.patch` versions.
- you can install all dependencies again using `npm install` again
- **package-lock.json** has exact versions installed and link of dependencies of each package.
- use `npm update` to update packages safely. `npm outdated` shows outdated and latest versions of packages installed in your **package.json**
- use `npm uninstall <package-name>` to uninstall packages from `package.json`
- `node_modules` should not be shared - you can make `.gitignore`to ignore them to be uploaded.

#### HTTP requests

Request object comprises of many properties, but important ones are :

- **Type of Request** : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.
- **Headers** : Meta data sent by your browser like browser name, cookies, authentication information etc.
- **Query Parameters** (url?`name=john`) : This is used in GET requests to send data to server
- **Route Params** (url/`john`)
- **Body data** : This is used in POST and other requests to send data to server

#### HTTP responses

Response object comprises of many properties, but important ones are :

- **Headers** : Meta data sent by your server back to client like server name, content size, last updated time etc.
- **Response status code** (`200`, `404`, `403`, `502`)
- **Response body** : Actual data to be sent to client : HTML, JS, JSON, CSS, Image etc.

#### More info

- HTTP requests and responses can be tracked from **Dev Tools** > **Network Tab**
- In Node, we can use core **http** module to create a Server which listens to requests, modify data in-between and provides responses. Server needs a **PORT** to be bound to - use only port number > 1024.
- Server can simply be said as **a function which receives a request and returns a response**. [ This is just for understanding]
- There are many **Headers** which exists on request and responses - shared a link below with list of existing headers.

- We can use Server to do 3 things:

  - **Static file Hosting** : Sending normal files without formatting or modifying.
  - **Server Side Rendering** : Mixing data with templates and rendering dynamic views (dynamic web pages)
  - **Web APIs** : Sending data via some APIs/ endpoints.

- Every Request has one and only one response. If there is more than 1 response which you want to send - you will encounter a error - "_Headers already sent_"
- POSTMAN is a software for doing complex API requests.

### [[Chapter Notes]]

- **ExpressJS** is _de-facto_ Node framework - and used in most Node applications which are used as web server.
- You can install express `npm install express`
- Express has few level of methods :

  - Application methods : e.g. app.use()
  - Request methods
  - Response methods
  - Middleware methods
  - Router methods

- **Response** methods (**res** is our response objects)
  - **res.send()** - for sending HTML
  - **res.sendFile(**) - for sending File
  - **res.json** - for sending JSON
  - **res.sendStatus(404)** - for sending HTTP status only
- **HTTP Request** Types we generally use :
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - DELETE
  - PATCH
- API / Endpoints / Routes are used inter-changeably but they are related to server paths.

- **Middle-ware** : Modifies the request before it reaches the next middleware or endpoints.
- Sequence of middleware is very important, as first middleware is first traversed by request.
- Middle-wares can be used for many use cases, like loggers, authentication, parsing data etc.
- Middle-ware can be :

  - Application level : server.use(**middleware**)
  - Router level : server.get('/', **middleware**, (req,res)=>{})
  - Built-in middleware : **express.json()** [ for parsing body data], **express.static()**[for static hosting]
  - External Middle-wares - like **morgan**

- **Request** properties (**req** is our request object)

  - **req.ip** - IP address of client
  - **req.method** - HTTP method of request
  - **req.hostname** - like google.com / localhost
  - **req.query** - for capturing query parameters from URL e.g. localhost:8080 ? **query=value**
  - **req.body** -for capturing request body data (but its needs a middleware for body data decoding)
  - **req.params** - for capturing URL parameters for route path like `/products/:id`

- **Static Hosting** : we can make 1 or more folders as static hosted using **express.static** middleware.
  `server.use(express.static(< directory >))`
  Static hosting is like sharing a folder/directory and making its file readable as it is.
  Note : `index.html` is default file which would be read in a static hosted folder, if you don't mention any file name.

3 major ways of sending data from client to server via request are :

**1. Send data via URL in Query String**

This is easiest method to send data and mostly used in GET request.

When you have URL with `?name=Youstart&subject=express` at end, it translates in a query string. In query string each key,value pair is separated by `=` and between 2 such pairs we put `&`.

To read such data in express you can use `req.query` :

```javascript
server.get("/demo", function (req, res) {
  console.log(req.query); // prints all data in request object
  res.send(req.query); // send back same data in response object
});
```

To install MONGODB NODE.JS DRIVER use this command

```javascript
npm install mongodb
```

You can setup database in Node server using following commands :

```javascript
const MongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient;
const assert = require("assert");
// Connection URL
const url = "mongodb://localhost:27017";
// Database Name
const dbName = "myproject";
// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function (err, client) {
  assert.equal(null, err);
  console.log("Connected correctly to server");
  const db = client.db(dbName);
});
```

### [[Chapter Notes]]

**Mongo Server**

- You can install **MongoDB community server** for your system and set the **Path** to `bin` folder
- You can choose your own database path while starting the **mongod** server

```
 mongod --dbpath <path-to-db-directory>
```

**Mongo Compass** : UI Client to see mongo server (local or remote)

**Mongo Shell** : Command-line based mongo client for checking mongo database.

Some Mongo Commands:

### Top Level commands :

(run from anywhere inside the shell)

- show dbs;
- use < database-name > - to choose a database and go inside its prompt

### Database CRUD commands :

(run only from inside a database)

#### CREATE COMMANDS

- db.< collectionName >.insertOne( _newDocument_ )
- db.< collectionName >.insertMany( _documentArray_ )

#### READ COMMANDS

- db.< collectionName >.**find**( _filterObject_ ) - to read all docs
- db.< collectionName >.**findOne**( _filterObject_ ) - to read one document
- db.< collectionName >.**countDocuments**( _filterObject_ ) - shows total number of documents.

**filter** Object : _{ fieldName : {operator: value}}_
fieldName : database fields name
**operator** : $eq = equal , $gt= greater than, $lt : less than, $gte = greater than equal, $and and $or operator
**value** : what value we are comparing with operator.

e.g { age : {$gt:5}}. - **age** is **greater than** value **5**

**Cursor functions :**
These are applied to find() query .

- **sort**( {fieldName: 1}) : 1 for ascending -1 for descending
- **limit**( x ) : only gives x documents

#### UPDATE COMMANDS

- db.< collectionName >.**updateOne**( _filterObject_, _updateObject_, options )
  - update Objects = _{ $set : {field: value}}_
  - options : _{upsert: true}_

**Upsert** : Update + Insert, when we want a new info to create a new objects if no existing object matches filter queries.

- db.< collectionName >.**replaceOne**( _filterObject_, _updateObject_ )
  Overwrites other fields also which are not in updateObject.

#### DELETE COMMANDS

- db.< collectionName >.**deleteOne**( _filterObject_ )

**Projection**

- Only return selected fields while returning result documents.
- db.< collectionName >.find( _filterObject_, projectionObject )
  e.g. {name:1, age:1, id:0} - only show **name** and **age** and don't show **id**

**MONGO ATLAS CLOUD SETUP** : Check the video in tutorial

** Environment Variable** : To use environment variable we can use a npm package called **dotenv** which will create new **process.env** variables.

- Install `dotenv` using `npm install dotenv`
- just have use `.env` file in your root directory
- and call `require('dotenv').config()`

### [[Reading Material]]

You can install mongoose using npm :

```bash
npm install mongoose
```

After installing , you can import mongoose to your project :

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
```

#### Connection to Database

To connect mongoose to your database `test`, you have to use the following commands :

```js
var mongoose = require("mongoose");
await mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test");
```

Connection can also be stored in a variable to check whether it is connected properly or not. Also to disconnect database later on. You can read more details [Here](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html)

#### Schema

Schema is the specification according to which data object is created in Database.

`taskSchema` which contains `title`, `status`, `date` fields. So every task object saved in database will have these 3 fields according to Schema given

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const taskSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  status: Boolean,
  date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```

Many types of data are allowed in Mongoose Schema. The common SchemaTypes are:

- String
- Number
- Date
- Boolean
- Mixed
- ObjectId
- Array

You can put a lot of conditions inside the Schema object :

```js
    age: { type: Number, default:18, min: 18, max: 65, required :true }
    // default value of Number is 18 and should be between 18-65, and can't be null or empty
```

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const { Schema } = mongoose;
const taskSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  status: Boolean,
  date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

const Task = mongoose.model("Task", taskSchema); //Task Model to create new database objects for `tasks` Collection
```

#### Task 1

Connect mongoose to a database named `todolist` if you don't have a database with this name. Mongoose will create it after you perform any insert operation.

Create a Schema named `taskSchema` and model named `Task` as shown above.

### CRUD in Mongoose

### Create - new objects

To Create new object in database we can use `new` keyword and create an object from Model. We can use `save()` function to save the object in database. Unless, you call save function - the object remains in memory. If your collection not yet created in MongoDB, it will created with name of Model pluralized (e.g Task will make a collection named `tasks`)

```js
server.post("/task", function (req, res) {
  let task = new Task();
  task.title = "shopping";
  task.status = true;
  task.date = new Date();
  task.save();
});
```

#### Task 2

You have to create an API Endpoint to type `POST` named `/task`. It will create a new task item in database whenever called properly. All 3 fields `title`, `status`, `date` must be mandatory (`required`). If someone is not passing all fields properly, no database entry should be created.

```js
//request body :
{
    "title" : "task1",
    "status" : true,
    "date" :'2010-05-30"
}
// response body should return the newly created object.
res.json(task);
```

Check using Mongo Compass/or Mongo Shell that new record in database is created. Also check name of collection. Is is `tasks` ?

### Read objects

To read new objects from database, one can use `find` query or similar queries. `find` queries also contain some conditions which can restrict what kind of data objects you want to read from database.

```js
server.get("/task/:name", function (req, res) {
  Task.findOne({ name: req.params.name }, function (err, doc) {
    console.log(doc); // this will contain db object
  });
});
server.get("/tasks", function (req, res) {
  Task.find({}, function (err, docs) {
    console.log(docs); // this is an array which contains all task objects
  });
});
```

#### Task 3

You have to create an API Endpoint to type `GET` named `/tasks`. It will return all task available in collection `tasks`.

```js
//request is GET so no data in body :
// response body should return the all db objects of collection tasks.
res.json(tasks);
```

Check Mongo Compass/or Mongo Shell - if all records are returned in response. How you will change this API to make it return only one database record in which `title` is matched with `title` sent in request `query`.

### Update - existing objects

To Update an existing object in database we need to first find an object from database and then update in database. This might be considered as a combination of `find` and `save` methods.
There are generally 2 cases in update :

1. Updating all values and overwriting the object properties completely.
2. Updating only few values by setting their new values.
   First scenario is covered using this query. Here you are overwriting all properties and resulting object will only have `name` property.

```js
server.put("/task/:name", function (req, res) {
  Task.findOneAndReplace(
    { name: req.params.name },
    { name: "YouStart" },
    { new: true },
    function (err, doc) {
      console.log(doc); // this will contain new db object
    }
  );
});
```

Second scenario is covered using this query. Here you are only changing value of `name` property in existing object without changing other values in Object.

```js
server.put("/task/:name",function(req,res){
    Task.findOneAndUpdate({name:req.params.name},{name:'YouStart'},,{new:true},function(err,doc){
        console.log(doc)  // this will contain db object
    })
})
```

#### Task 4

You have to create an API Endpoint to type `PUT` named `/task/:id`. It will update existing task item in database which has ObjectId set to `id` you have passed.

```js
//request params will have id in URL path :
{
    "title" : "task-changed",
}
// response body should return the newly updated object.
res.json(task);
```

Check using Mongo Compass/or Mongo Shell that only `title` of record in database is changed. All other properties remain the same.

### Delete - existing objects

To Delete existing object from database we need to first find an object from database and then delete. This might be considered as a combination of `find` and `delete` methods.

```js
server.delete("/task/:name", function (req, res) {
  Task.findOneAndDelete({ name: req.params.name }, function (err, doc) {
    console.log(doc); // this will contain deleted object object
  });
});
```

#### Task 5

You have to create an API Endpoint to type `DELETE` named `/task/:id`. It will delete existing task item in database which has ObjectId set to `id` you have passed.

```js
//request params will have id in URL path :
// response body should return the deleted object.
res.json(task);
```

Check using Mongo Compass/or Mongo Shell that the record is deleted or not.

### [[Chapter Notes]]

- install mongoose
  `npm install mongoose`
- Mongoose connection code

```javascript
main().catch((err) => console.log(err));
async function main() {
  await mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test");

  // use `await mongoose.connect('mongodb://user:password@127.0.0.1:27017/test');` if your database has auth enabled
}
```

- Mongoose **Schema** : Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.

```javascript
const productSchema = new Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  description: String,
  price: { type: Number, min: [0, "wrong price"], required: true },
  discountPercentage: {
    type: Number,
    min: [0, "wrong min discount"],
    max: [50, "wrong max discount"],
  },
  rating: {
    type: Number,
    min: [0, "wrong min rating"],
    max: [5, "wrong max rating"],
  },
  brand: { type: String, required: true },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  thumbnail: { type: String, required: true },
  images: [String],
});
```

- Mongoose **Model** : model are built using a combination of Schema and name of Collection.

```javascript
const Product = mongoose.model("Product", productSchema);
```

- Mongoose **Document** - its is instance of a model. so Model is like a class and documents are like its objects. These documents are directly saved in mongoDB.

```javascript
const document = new Product();
// document is actually saved in database after save()
await document.save();
```

Mongoose Schema/Model can act as **Model** of **Model**-View-Controller concept.

### CRUD API and mongoose methods

**CREATE** :

1. **create product** - use **POST ** HTTP Method

```javascript
const product = new Product();
await product.save();
```

**READ** :

1. **read all products** - use **GET** HTTP Method

```javascript
const products = await Product.find();
const products = await Product.find({ price: { $gt: 500 } });
```

2. **read 1 product** - use **GET** HTTP Method

```javascript
const product = await Product.findById(id);
```

**UPDATE** :

1. replace product fields (all fields) - use **PUT** HTTP Method

```javascript
const doc = await Product.findOneAndReplace({ _id: id }, req.body, {
  new: true,
});
```

2. update only some product fields - use **PATCH** HTTP Method

```javascript
const doc = await Product.findOneAndUpdate({ _id: id }, req.body, {
  new: true,
});
```

**DELETE** :

1. delete 1 product - use **DELETE** HTTP Method

```javascript
const doc = await Product.findOneAndDelete({ _id: id });
```

### [[Assignments]]

- **Assignment 1** : Make a Schema for `user` with `userSchema` which has these conditions :

  - `firstName` is required, maximum length 16 chars
  - `lastName` is not required, maximum length 16 chars
  - `age` is a Number, minimum value 12, maximum 100
  - `email` make a validator of email, as given in mongoose documentation.
  - `address` make address a nested data structure which has its own Schema [ **AddressSchema** ??] [ Hint: check mongoose documentation for sub-documents to do it

  Create `addressSchema` needed in above example as :

  - `pincode` : Number, required
  - `street` : String, required
  - `phone`: String, length=10

Now try to create this **user** object and **save** it to database.

- What happens to **addresses** ? How address **document** is stored ? check if it creates a **new collection** in database
- What happens if you don't provide validated data in any field. [Note: Throw proper errors strings ]

**Sending data from front-end to Server**

1. Fetch : it is in-built API in the browser
2. Axios : we will use **axios** as it is easier to use.

   **CORS Issues :**

CORS - [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) ([CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS)) is a standard that allows a server to relax the [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)

- we will use CORS package to allow cross origin request from **React JS** server to **NodeJS** server as they are on different hosts.
- `npm install cors`
- to use cors -

```javascript
const cors = require("cors");
server.use(cors());
```

**HTML Forms**

- `name` attribute on input elements is used to send data keys which are validated with schema in backend.

### Build a React Project :

- Run `npm run build`
- use `build` folder to be hosted on public hosting/static hosting

### Host a React Project :

you can use `build` folder of react and add it to static hosting of express.
`server.use(express.static('build'));`

### Use Routing in Front-end

use wildcard in express route to point to React single page applications (index.html)

```javascript
res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "build", "index.html"));
```

`__dirname` is a variable

### [[Chapter Notes]]

**Preparation for deployment**

- First check whether front-end routes are independent of server, and make all of them relative to `/`
- Connect MongoDB atlas - in-place of mongo local database

### How to Deploy to Vercel :

- Commit you code on a github account (personal account for free services)
- Set Environment Variables on Vercel - like MONGO_URL, PUBLIC_DIR
- Put a vercel config file - `vercel.json` in your project root directory.
- After every change, commit your changes - and push code on github.
- You have to provide permission for github directory to vercel. It will pickup `vercel.json` and `package.json` and deploy your code accordingly.
- Check video for more details.
